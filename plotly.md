# Bivariate Choropleth Plotly Dashboard

Example of ploty map: [Map](https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~empet/15191/texas-bivariate-choropleth-assoc/#/) 

Milestones:
1. Create a bivariate choropleth plotly dashboard
2. Create a dropdown to choose between variables for the bivariate part of the graph.
3. US view and specific state view when chosen from dropdown. (state should be below the US map)
4. When state is selected, a table should populate with the information in the state.

1. Create a bivariate choropleth plotly dashboard
What is a bivariate choropleth map?

A "bivariate choropleth map" is a type of thematic map that represents two different variables simultaneously using color gradients to visualize spatial patterns across geographic regions.

In a traditional choropleth map, as mentioned earlier, only one variable is represented using color gradients to show variations in that specific variable across geographic areas. However, in a bivariate choropleth map, two distinct variables are visualized using color gradients simultaneously. Each geographic region on the map is shaded with a combination of two colors, one for each variable.
